# Numpy
A beginner's guide to Numpy
Hello there, Welcome to the world of Data Science. This is a guide to the new fellows who wan tto learn numpy library to master the concept of array and matrices in python.

INTRODUCTION TO NUMPY LIBRARY
So lets start with knowing what numpy actually is ?
Well, Numpy (Numerical Python) is a python library which is widely used for scientific computing in Python. It supports large, multiple dimensional arrays and matrices, along with vast methods which allows you to perform numerous operations on arrays and matrices. It was developed by Travis Oliphant in 2005. Is is an open source project that has become one the fundamental tools for Data analysis, data science and machine learning.

The key features of Numpy are:
1. N-Dimensional Array Object:
   It is a powerful ndarray, which allows for efficient storage and manipulation of large datasets.
2. Mathematical functions:
   It offers vast array of mathemmatical functions such as liners algebra, statistics, set operations and random number generation.
3. Broadcasting:
   This feature allowss for opertaions on arrays of different shapes, facilitating vectorized operations that arer both concise and fast.
4. Integrations with other Libraries:
   It can easily integrates with other popular python linraries like Scipy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.
5. Performance:
   Numpy operations are highly optimized, providing signoficant performance improvement over standard python lists.

One question may come in our mind that if we alredy have lists in python that does exactly the some things as numpy then why was it essential to develop Numpy?
Well, we prefer Numpy over Lists because of the performance and spped of Numpy which is less with Lists in python. Also Numpy arrays occupy less memory compared to lists as they syore data in contiguous block of memory, allowing for more efficient memory access patterns.

In this tutorial, you will come across the way data is manipulated using this awesome library and learn many concepts of it through simple code snippets.
So, lets dive straight into the code section...
Happy Learning.
